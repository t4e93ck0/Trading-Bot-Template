# Trading-Bot-Template
A basic template of a trading bot coded in Python
The code provided defines a trading strategy using the backtrader library. The strategy is based on technical indicators such as Bollinger Bands, RSI, and MACD. It also uses a neural network model defined using TensorFlow to make trading decisions.

The strategy is implemented as a class named MyStrategy which inherits from the bt.Strategy class. The parameters of the strategy, such as the symbol, lot size, stop loss, take profit, and daily loss limit, are defined as class attributes in the params tuple. The strategy also defines several instance variables such as upper_band, middle_band, lower_band, rsi, macd, macd_signal, last_order, daily_pnl, num_open_positions, and closed_trades.

In the __init__ method of the strategy, the technical indicators are initialized using historical price data obtained from the MetaTrader5 platform. The values of the indicators are printed to the console. In the next method, the current price and indicator values are printed to the console. The method then checks if the daily loss limit has been exceeded and closes all positions if it has. It also checks if the maximum number of open positions has been reached and returns if it has. If the conditions for entering a long position are met, the method submits a buy order with the specified lot size and order execution type.
